      <h3 style="color: #0A837E;font-size: 23px;">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;padding-bottom: 2%;">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
        The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably
        the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post
        a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals
        with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
